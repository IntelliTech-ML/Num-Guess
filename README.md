## ‚ú® Core Features

This game comes packed with features designed to enhance your gameplay and keep you entertained:

* **Dynamic User Interface:** Crafted with the **Windows.h API**, the game boasts a clean and responsive interface, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience. All controls are clearly laid out for easy navigation.
* **Intelligent Random Number Generation:** At the start of each game, a new secret number (between 1 and 10) is pseudo-randomly generated using `srand(time(0))` and `rand() % 10 + 1`. This ensures unpredictability and replayability for endless fun.
* **Intuitive Input and Feedback:** Players can simply type their guess into the dedicated **input box**. Upon clicking the **"Guess" button**, immediate feedback is provided, indicating whether your guess was **"Too high!"**, **"Too low!"**, or **"Congratulations!"**
* **Strategic Hint System:** Stuck on a number? The **"Hint" button** (which appears after your second attempt) offers helpful clues related to the secret number. These hints, defined in a `Hint` struct array, are designed to guide your deductions without giving away the answer directly. For example, guessing "1" might yield the hint "The Topper," while "6" might be "Hardly Comes in Dice."
* **Rewarding Point System:** The game incorporates a nuanced scoring mechanism that rewards efficiency and penalizes excessive attempts.
    * **Higher points** are awarded for guessing the number in fewer attempts.
    * **Points are deducted** if the correct number is not found within the maximum allowed tries.
    * Your **total points** are tracked and displayed, encouraging players to improve their guessing strategy.
* **Instant Game Reset:** A **"Restart" button** (which appears once the game is won or lost) allows for quick replays, enabling players to immediately jump into a new round without restarting the application.
* **Adaptive Control Visibility:** Certain game elements, like the **Hint** and **Restart** buttons, dynamically appear or hide based on the game's state, providing a clutter-free interface and guiding the player through the current stage of the game.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

To enjoy "Guess the Number" on your Windows machine, follow these straightforward steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection), often included with MinGW or Cygwin on Windows, is highly recommended.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your command prompt or Git Bash and clone the game's repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/guess-the-number-game.git](https://github.com/yourusername/guess-the-number-game.git)
    ```
    (Note: Replace `yourusername` with the actual GitHub username if you're cloning from a specific fork.)
3.  **Navigate to the Game Directory:** Change your current directory to the newly cloned game folder:
    ```bash
    cd guess-the-number-game
    ```
4.  **Compile the Source Code:** Compile the `main.c` file using GCC. The `-o` flag specifies the output executable name:
